You missed it? I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. Don&amp;rsquo;t let it happen again! Github Universe is awesome. Some things that stood out for me:
1) No Badge Scanning It took me no more than 30 seconds to get through registration and collect my badge, a process that brings with it the reminder of how many times I&amp;rsquo;m going to be scanned onto follow-up email and call lists for things I&amp;rsquo;m really not interested in.</description></item></channel></rss>
