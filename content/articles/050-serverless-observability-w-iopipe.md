Episode #50. Wooohooo! And for this landmark 50th episode we're delighted to have super-popular Serverless observability company, [IOpipe](https://www.iopipe.com/), on the show. In this episode (video below) I'm joined by IOpipe founder and CTO, [Erica Windisch](https://twitter.com/ewindisch).

_"Unless you set your concurrency for the lambda to '1', right, which you could do \[LAUGHS\], you're opting into building a distributed system."_

Erica dropped out of school and joined a web hosting company in 2001. At the time she was looking for better orchestration and observability solutions but nothing came close to her requirements... so, she started building the tools she needed. "_Through all of this we were spending all this time focussing on building the best orchestration tool, and management tool, and customer experience from deployment automation but so little effort was being spent on really amazing tools to operate and manage these workloads._" Always at the cutting edge – one of the early developers on OpenStack, and an early employee at Docker – Erica started looking at Serverless-type technologies back in 2010. On how thing differ between traditional architecture and Serverless she shares, "_you get this amazing scale but you're also opting in to building a distributed system_". This brings new complexities that IOpipe can really help with. Watch this episode to understand the level of confidence her company gets from their offering and how "_IOpipe production infrastructure monitors itself with IOpipe production infrastructure_". https://youtu.be/Hiur9bx1noY Thanks for listening!
