We share some of our personal struggles and how we deal with things like 'victim mindset' to take control of our lives and achieve more without stress and anxiety. With the right mindset, getting through tough times, like what we are facing now, can be much easier.

I'm going to keep the words to a minimum on this one, you'll just have to watch the video to understand all the elements of how we're successfully navigating life and all its stresses and remaining optimistic and focused on the end game...
