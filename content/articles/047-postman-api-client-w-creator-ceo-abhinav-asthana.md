![](https://www.getpostman.com/img/v2/media-kit/Logo/PNG/pm-logo-horiz.png) Very excited about today's episode where I'm joined by Abhinav Ashtana, the creator and CEO of world renowned API client, POSTMAN.   In this episode, hear Abhinav explain how POSTMAN started – how a personal frustration with API interactions presented an opportunity to create something cool. Learn about the journey POSTMAN took and the use cases that shaped its form today. Lastly, hear about the latest POSTMAN training capabilities shipping in version 7.0 (totally free) to better enable adoption by learning directly within the product as you use it. Take a peek at this capability in the POSTMAN blog [here](https://blog.getpostman.com/2019/01/11/in-app-postman-lessons/). https://youtu.be/maUJl8f71V8 Thanks for listening!
