In this episode I'm joined by [Michael Fraser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itascode/) of [refactr](https://www.refactr.it/) to talk about DevSecOps.

Coming from the ops side, Michael's desire to simplify security automation derived from personal experience in stitching together security tooling to support delivery/deployment pipelines. Knowing how many security technologies weren't developed from an API first perspective, the need for refactr was evident. Three years in, the business is growing, DevSecOps is evolving, and we're delighted to have Michael on the show to talk about this journey.
