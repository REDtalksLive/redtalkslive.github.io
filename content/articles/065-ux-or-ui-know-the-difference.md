Delighted to be joined by Product Designer, [Nina Goluskin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ninagoluskin/), in this episode to shed some light on the differences between UX and UI.

They are often lumped together, in media coverage and even job postings, as a combined concept, but the truth is they require completely different skill and experience to execute properly. Listen to this episode to hear an expert on the subject explain the reality with some super simple examples.
