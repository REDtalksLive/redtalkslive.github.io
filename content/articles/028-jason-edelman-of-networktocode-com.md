Today we're joined by Jason Edelman, co-founder of awesome network automation training and services company [networktocode.com](http://networktocode.com/), and co-author of the recently published O'Reilly book titled, "[Network Programmability and Automation](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042082.do)". ![](https://covers.oreillystatic.com/images/0636920042082/lrg.jpg) As the subtitle states, this book is a reference tool aimed at developing "skills for the next-generation network engineer". Joined by co-authors, Scott S. Lowe & Matt Oswalt, the book covers many great concepts, including one pushed heavily by the [f5.com/super-netops](https://f5.com/super-netops) training program (and one of my personal favorites), the importance of abstraction and templating.
