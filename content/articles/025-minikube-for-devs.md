Another great episode from our F5 Incubator friends, [ApsenMesh.io](https://aspenmesh.io/). In this episode I'm joined by Sr Architect, Andrew Jenkins, who explains how, in mere seconds, he spins up Kubernetes clusters on his laptop in a docker container. An awesome solution for rapid dev/test environments that I will be adopting as soon as I've hit post on this article. Here's the video with Andrew:

And here's a blog Andrew put together with the technical details:Â [Building Istio with Minikube-in-a-Container and Jenkins](https://aspenmesh.io/blog/2018/01/building-istio-with-minikube-in-a-container-and-jenkins/) Many thanks for joining us on REDtalks.live, Andrew. I look forward to hearing from you again!
