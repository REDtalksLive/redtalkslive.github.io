Episode #15 brings us the topic of ChatOps. No, I'm not talking about late nights dialed into [bulletin board chat groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) on your 9600 bit/s modem! ChatOps is about cross team collaboration and information sharing. Who better to join me in this episode than the author of O'Reilly's "[ChatOps - Managing Operations in Group Chat](https://victorops.com/knowledge-drop/devops-docs/chatops-managing-operations-group-chat/)", Jason Hand.
