F5 long-timer, Joe Pruitt, joins me in this episode to discuss API Lifecycle Management! Joe joined F5 back in 1998 to build BIG-IP management and API solutions. He built the original BIG-IP API, iControl, back 2001: first in CORBA, and then SOAP/XML. Click play to hear Joe's experiences with building robust APIs suitable for modern Infrastructure as Code practices, and hear why he's returned to the product development team after several years building F5's developer community platform, DevCentral.f5.com. https://youtu.be/vDhtqwy0q7s Thanks for joining us, Joe!
