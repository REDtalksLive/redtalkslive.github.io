Greetings viewers and welcome to a short series of technical demonstrations on Infrastructure as Code. In my field experience I noticed that most Infrastructure as Code implementations were oriented around 'server' infrastructure. As a huge fan of developer tooling being used to improve traditional operations, I thought I'd take a look at bringing Infrastructure as Code practices to managing F5's BIG-IP App Services appliances. In this video you'll see the management of L4 - L7 App Services entirely from within GitHub Enterprise. Totes cool, right! In this first episode I'l just run through a quick demo, followed by a more detailed review in Part 2 (coming soon).
