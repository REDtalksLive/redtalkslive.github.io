Soooooooo, I got a little overzealous with the Quarantined Nerd Challenge dates. Whoopsy. Shortly after posting challenge #1 both Kin Lane and I got super busy and two weeks just flew past.

Resetting expectations, QNC 2020 will continue but the event end dates will be on the <quarantine end date>.

More examples to come very soon, and the details of challenge #2.

Update video below! Details of the QNC here: [https://redtalks.live/quarantined-nerd-challenge/](https://redtalks.live/quarantined-nerd-challenge/)
