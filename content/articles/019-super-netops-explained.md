Due to popular demand, here is a short (16 minute) video explanation of the Super-NetOps persona. I frequently give talks on the need for Super-NetOps engineers and architects to support modern development/DevOps processes. However, that talk (especially with enthusiastic Q&A sessions) takes about 90 minutes. Hence, below is a quick 'why you need Super-NetOps' version I put together for those in a hurry. Brilliantly summarized by my colleague, [Joe Cassidy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephccassidy/), "_Great short video by [Nathan Pearce](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pearcenathan/) explaining the "Super-NetOps" concept wherein NetOps embraces principles and practices of DevOps to reduce the skills gap between Infrastructure and Developer silos. Like DevOps, "Super-NetOps" is not a technology, tool or person but rather a culture change where infrastructure teams adopt "systems thinking". This shifting focus towards "systems thinking" empowers the traditional infrastructure silos to collaborate, continuously improve delivery, enhance communication, enable self-service and speed development. F5 is helping enterprises embrace this concept by (among other things) enabling APIs, exposing Declarative Interfaces and executing on Self-Service Models and Templates._"
