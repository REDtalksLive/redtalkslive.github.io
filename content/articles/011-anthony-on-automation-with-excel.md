UPDATED: Feb 9th, 2017 The beauty of REST is that you can call upon it from just about anywhere. REST doesn't care which OS you are using or whether you prefer a command-line tool over a GUI, or vice versa. Most importantly, engineers can start benefitting from REST APIs without the need for huge corporate investments and monolithic orchestration projects. Proving this point, in episode #11 we have Anthony Gerace who demonstrates an accelerated device on-boarding solution using Microsoft Excel (and some VBA script). Anthony has been at the foundation of MANY demonstrations and proof-of-concept projects. Watch this episode to see how he's simplified his own workflows, and helped many others get started, with this fine example of how REST APIs are for everyone! https://youtu.be/eRbxvBgy9Mk Thanks for joining us, Anthony!
