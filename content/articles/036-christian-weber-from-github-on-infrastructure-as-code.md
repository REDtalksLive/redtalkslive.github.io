Delighted to have GitHub's Christian Weber on the show this week to share his experiences with Infrastructure as Code. Watch this episode to hear Christian explain some personal experiences, from his days before he worked at GitHub, where Infrastructure/Configuration as Code would have made a big difference. Learn from first-hand experience how certain practices can bring order back to a dire situations.  But if you're too busy right now, you could just come and hear our talk at the F5 Agility conference in Boston (August 13th - 16th) titled "Super-NetOps: Configuration as Code"

"...by treating everything, like a configuration file, as a template we go back into our previous state **without relying on a failure state as a means of recovery**..."
