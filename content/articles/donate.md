REDtalks.live needs your help to keep running!

Since 2016 I've been covering all the hosting and services costs. I'm not complaining – its been an honor to have been in a situation do so. However, as I've spent much of the last year in a startup working mostly for free, as you can imagine, this has made the running costs seem a lot less trivial.

So, to keep things running while I'm searching for employment, I've created a [GoFundMe Page](http://gf.me/u/xuxab3) for the modest request of $294 – enough to keep running until October 2020!

**APRIL 5TH UPDATE:** I'm truly humbled to find, after only 2 days, we're already past the halfway mark. Thank you so much for your generosity.

Thanks for listening!

Nathan
