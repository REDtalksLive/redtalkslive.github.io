In this page you'll find the 'Focus' spreadsheet referenced in [Episode 57](https://redtalks.live/2020/03/30/57-remote-working-staying-focused/).

There are two versions, one for MS Excel and one for Google Sheets (Sorry, Apple Numbers users.).

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q. How long should I set a focus session?**

**A.** Start with shorter focus sessions, e.g. 20 minutes. You can change them at any time, even during the day. Don't be afraid to experiment/adjust.

**Q. What if I'm being really productive and the session ends?**

**A.** There are no rules, only a desire to focus. If you're having a really productive moment and the focus session ends, keep going. Don't fight focussed productivity but try not to skip the longer breaks so you don't burnout.
