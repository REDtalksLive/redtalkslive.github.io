In episode #16 we are joined by Andreas (Andy) Grabner, of [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com), and Tom McGonagle, of F5 Networks. Watch this episode to hear about Metrics Driven Automation, or Informed Automation, and how this takes the feat out of fully integrated deployment pipelines. Andy shares some great insights on how to avoid automating oneself into dangerous situations. Following this, Tom shows us (yes, a live demo) how to deploy an F5 BIG-IP policy using the CI/CD tool, Jenkins. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQVHkWxIvfA   You may recall Tom from a previous episode, [REDtalks #14 – Tom & David on the Principles & Practices of DevOps](http://redtalks.live/2017/01/13/redtalks-14-tom-david-on-the-principles-practices-of-devops/).
