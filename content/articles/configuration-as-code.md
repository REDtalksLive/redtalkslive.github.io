![IaC_Logo-300dpi](https://redtalkslive.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/iac_logo-300dpi.png) Welcome to the "Configuration as Code" microsite on [REDtalks.live](https://redtalks.live/). As part of my investigation into Network Configuration as Code I created a Github Webhook integration project for the F5 BIG-IP called [BigHook.](https://github.com/npearce/BigHook) BigHook enables people to manage their BIG-IP L4 - L7 Services configurations (deploy/redeploy/delete) entirely from within Github / GitHub Enterprise. UPDATE: I've created some new videos which were recorded for Github Universe:

*   [Quick Intro](https://youtu.be/qebrAvUrcyA)
*   [RBAC & (Safe) Rollback](https://youtu.be/BKF9nmtQbpI)
*   [Advanced: Multi-Change Commit](https://youtu.be/TzNKB1_oW5Y)

Here are some articles about that integration, with demonstration videos:
