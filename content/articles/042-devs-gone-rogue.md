There's lots of talk in the computer networking media about the need to pick up some scripting/coding skills to stay relevant in the modern agile/DevOps world. To better understand this perspective, in episode #42 we take a look at it from the opposite direction... from that of two developers who switched to networking! Joining me in this episode, Cody (who I refer to as 'Cory', not once, but twice... sorry, Cody - if that even is your name...) Green, and Daniel Edgar explain how developers look at networking and how to avoid the common miscommunication problems between the two important but very different worlds. Thanks for joining me CODY Green and Daniel Edgar!
