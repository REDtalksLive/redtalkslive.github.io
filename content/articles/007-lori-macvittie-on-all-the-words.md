Struggling to keep up with all the new terminology? F5's Lori MacVittie joins us again to discuss some of the many new, and often confusing, terms coming to us with the DevOps movement. In this episode we cover everything from the differences between "NetOps vs WebOps vs DevOps", why we see terms like "OpsDev" (yuk) in the media, and the all-important difference between CI/CD and the other CD. We hope you enjoy! https://youtu.be/5kOn9Ju6yT8 Thanks again for stopping  by, Lori.
