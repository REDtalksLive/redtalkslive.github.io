We were lucky enough to get Michael O'Leary back so soon for another episode, and, this time, a self-service demonstration. In "[REDtalks #04 – Michael O’Leary on orchestration with VMware vRO](https://redtalks.live/2016/10/05/redtalks-04-michael-oleary-on-orchestration-with-vmware-vro/)" we discussed the benefits of automating infrastructure and Michael shared some great tips on how to get started. In this episode Michael demonstrates one of his self-service solutions that enables the generation of tiny-URL's for his internal customers. The solution uses VMware vRealize (vRO and vRA), Infoblox, and an F5 BG-IP.
