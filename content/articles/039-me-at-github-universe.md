Last week Github Universe happened. You missed it? I'm sorry. Don't let it happen again! Github Universe is awesome. Some things that stood out for me:

### 1) No Badge Scanning

It took me no more than 30 seconds to get through registration and collect my badge, a process that brings with it the reminder of how many times I'm going to be scanned onto follow-up email and call lists for things I'm really not interested in. Nope, not at Github Universe. Everyone is free to communicate without a sales/marketing push.

### 2) The Right People

Every sponsor stand I visited was staffed with the people that created/architected their offering. I can't recall a conference where every interaction resulted in all the answers to all the questions, at once. That was pretty sweet, right there! A quick example, I stopped by the Microsoft stand part way through a VS Code demo. I was approached and asked if I had any questions by an employee, who turned out to be one of the developers behind the Github Pull Request extension. Immediately after asking a question about the extension we were both looking at the source code and I was getting a detailed walk-through. This made my week! And it didn't just happen once...

### 3) Culture

The people at Github Universe were all on the same side: the sponsors, the guests, the event support staff, everyone went out of their way to ensure the best experience was had by all. I really cannot fault the execution...

### 4) My awesome demonstration!

Last, but not least, I appeared on the Github Universe Demo Desk where I demonstrated managing some F5 BIG-IP virtual appliances via Github Enterprise and the practice of Network Configuration as Code. Here's the powerpoint presentation: [Introducing Network Configuration as Code](https://www.slideshare.net/NathanPearce/2018-github-universe-network-configuration-as-code) And here are the videos:
