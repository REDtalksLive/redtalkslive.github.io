Mark Wall and Joe Weber of WWT join me in lucky episode #13 to discuss automation with Cisco CloudCenter (the artist formerly known as CliQr). As many already know, in 2016 Cisco bought CliQr, which has since been renamed Cisco [CloudCenter](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/cloudcenter/index.html). Watch this episode to see how CliQr is used to deploy applications while also configuring Cisco ACI (connectivity fabric), VMware vSphere, Infoblox, and F5 BIG-IP LTM in one single automation workflow. In the first half of the video we hear from Mark and Joe about their experiences with customer automation. They share with us the typical experiences of an infrastructure admins journey from being a 'button pusher' to being a 'button creator' before closing out the first half of the talk by sharing their understanding of the markets maturity with automation. We then enter the second half of the video where Joe explains the CliQr workflow he's built, with the aid of some helpful diagrams, before throwing caution to the wind and providing a live demonstration (this from the 36 minute mark).
