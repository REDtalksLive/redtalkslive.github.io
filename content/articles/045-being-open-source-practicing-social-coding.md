Great to have GitHub's Christian Weber (t: [@classicwebdog](https://twitter.com/classicwebdog)) on the show again to help us understand what being part of the open-source community is all about. Some key theme's from this episode:

1.  Git **IS** all about 'Social Coding'
2.  GitHub is **NOT** your download server
3.  Adopting open-source is a lot like hosting a meetup; be present, communicate, and listen
4.  Be receptive to feedback
