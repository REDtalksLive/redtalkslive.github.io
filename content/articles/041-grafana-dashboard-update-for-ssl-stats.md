Watch this episode to see how you can view F5 BIG-IP SSL statistics in the latest Grafana Dashboard for the BigStats telemetry exporter. Well, I know I already posted the end of year wrap-up episode ([REDtalks.live #40 â€“ 2018 in Review](http://redtalks.live/2018/12/29/redtalks-live-40-2018-in-review/)) but I had a little free time and here we are on the very last day of the year with an update to add SSL statistics to the Grafana Dashboard for BigStats.
