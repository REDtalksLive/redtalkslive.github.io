Greeting automators and welcome to edisode #17 of REDtalks. Today's guest is Tyler Hatton who is from WWTs own internal IT Operations team. Tyler is the F5 BIG-IP Subject Matter Expert for WWT and is hell-bent on replacing the mundane with declarative interfaces and orchestration systems. Watch this episode to hear about the interesting culture at WWT and their regular hack-a-thon's. These events themed at breaking the routine and investing internally in continuous education and, my favorite, "continuous improvement". Following this, Hatton talks us through his brilliantly named, hack-a-thon winning, "(P)orchestrator" solution! Tune it to understand the time-saving, self-service interface that Tyler produced, quite literally, from the Ops 'drivers seat'. https://youtu.be/KPFh9L7NWjU   Many thanks, Tyler, for sharing your story!
