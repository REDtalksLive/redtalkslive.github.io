Want to learn about Service Mesh? Well, you're in luck! Today I am joined by [Shawn Wormke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnwormke/), Sr. Director of Aspen Mesh – [aspenmesh.io](https://aspenmesh.io) – an F5 Networks Incubator innovation. Aspen Mesh is an 'enterprise service mesh' built on Istio. In her [recent blog](https://f5.com/about-us/blog/articles/open-source-spotlight-f5-announces-it-will-commit-more-than-code-28904), industry thought leader, Lori MacVittie ([@lmacvittie](https://twitter.com/lmacvittie)), announced the drivers behind launching Aspen Mesh with: "_...we believe a robust microservice communication fabric is the best possible path to scaling containerized apps whether in the data center or in the cloud (or both). But we also understand the needs and complexity of enterprise production environments. A service-mesh needs to do more than just scale apps; it also needs to monitor and secure them._" Watch this video to understand the future of Aspen Mesh: the microservices architecture its destined for, and the use cases it will address regarding the application of dynamic policy and service visibility through continuous feedback.
