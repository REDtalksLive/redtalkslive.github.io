Another episode of REDtalks and this time, from the financial services industry, I bring you Michael O'Leary. Michael shares with us his experiences working with VMware's suite of automation and orchestration technologies, and some great work he's done with F5 iRules and Microsoft PowerShell. Throughout the conversation, Michael goes into detail about the lessons learned when starting out with automation. In addition to his promise that automation will not eliminate your job. Instead, it will enable you to excel at your job. Enough words from me, take a look at the latest episode and please share your thoughts!
