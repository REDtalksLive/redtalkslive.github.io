Our very first REDtalks guest, Hitesh Patel, is back again to help us understand a fundamental architectural shift in how systems must change to support a Mode 2 methodology. In this episode we talk about levels of abstraction and how they effect automation processes. We discuss the operational overhead involved in supporting infinite deployment options versus adopting a service templating process, and how this hinges on the abstraction of domain-specific knowledge. Explained through the art of sandwich making versus microwaving a burrito, listen to this episode to understand the differences between imperative and declarative models.
