Welcome to episode 44 of REDtalks.live, your home of Ranting, Engineers, and Devops, where I'm joined by F5 Networks Global Security Solution Architect, Benn Alp. Benn brings perspective based on many years of security experience across a range of roles and verticals. Learned in this episode:

1.  DevSecOps is finally getting some traction.
2.  Security vendors have started making more programmable security tooling.
3.  Culture is the most important thing to change in security. Removing the 'no team' label often attributed to security practitioners starts within the security team and how they serve the business.
4.  Benn's arm movements are faster than the YouTube live-streaming frames per second transmission out of 'Straya.
