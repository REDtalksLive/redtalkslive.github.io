Great to have Joel King join me again on REDtalks.live to answer the question, "What is code?" The answer isn't as straightforward as you may think, not with practices like Infrastructure as Code at play. In this episode, Joel does a great job at clarifying some misconceptions and clearing up some concepts that should not have been assumed one way or the other. Also, a significant bonus, I learned more about the Apollo Space Missions in this episode than I thought I'd ever know. Thanks for the wealth of space-launch knowledge, Joe. https://youtu.be/CKVvlUrsDaQ Thanks for listening!
