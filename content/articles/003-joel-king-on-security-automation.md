Back again for another episode of REDtalks and with me this week is Joel King from WWT. Joel joins us to discuss his award winning security automation solution that integrates Phantom Cyber, Ansible, F5 BIG-IP, and Cisco ACI. Watch this episode to hear why Joel focused on these technologies and to understand that security, too, has much to gain from joining your automation workflows. Joel shows us that security can just as easily be a part of your continuous deployment toolchains as any other system.Â And he really did win an award for it!
