API Contracts, or 'API Parenting' as I like to call it, is a critical part of API creation and delivery. So, if you're thinking if implementing an API, or maybe you already have and things aren't going so well, then this is the episode for you! For API consumers, the API Contract sets expectations. It lets you know whether functionality may change at short notice, or not. It informs you of rate-limiting policies, and of the providers uptime/availability commitments. As an API consumer, you should demand API contracts of your providers to inspire confidence in your API consumption choices. For API creators/providers, your consumers get all of the above â€“ confidence in your API. If you love your customers/consumers, you'll provide them an API contract, and honor it. To learn more about API contracts, from the API evangelist ([apievangelist.com](http://apievangelist.com/)), Kin Lane, himself, watch this episode! https://youtu.be/JpRRU80j0DI Thanks for listening!
