Today brought us the first episode of REDtalks (Ranting Engineers on DevOps) â€“ a video podcast by nerds, and for nerds. In this first installment I talk with F5 Solution Architect, Hitesh Patel, on the topic of 'code sharing'. Many believe that giving away code is for the open source projects. Hitesh explains how wrong this perception is, and backs this up with examples from his years of experience as both a network engineer and an application developer. https://youtu.be/5GRFRRpuWRY Thanks for taking the time to stop by, Hitesh. We'd love to have you on again!
