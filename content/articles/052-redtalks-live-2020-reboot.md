It's been truly humbling to hear all the positive encouragement when I shared that I was considering a relaunch of the REDtalks.live show. Thank you!

I'm really excited about this 2020 REBOOT and, with the Shelter at home orders, I've decided to start out with a mini series on working from home.

Many people have significant experienced working remote and I'd like to share some to their tips and tricks to help those less familiar. In the first episode I'm going to cover what I think is the most important of all, Empathy.

Anywho, here's me saying how awesome it is to reconnect with y'all!
