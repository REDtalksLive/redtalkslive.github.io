With the evolution of application architecture – from monolith to distributed, microservice – comes the need for modern 'architecture appropriate' monitoring and visibility solutions. Traditional 'packet sniffer' tooling falls short in terms of the requirements developers need to transition from best-effort, educated guesses to detailed usage logging and traceability. To help realize these _deep API monitoring_ goals, in this episode I'm joined by Founder and CEO of [resurface.io](https://resurface.io), Rob Dickinson.  Rob, who has a long history in the traditional application monitoring space, tells us how the tools and approaches of yesterday just don't work in today's distributed, microservice, 'API first' world. Watch this episode to understand how [resurface.io](https://resurface.io) delivers "DevOps-friendly instrumentation" for the modern, agile service. https://youtu.be/IBKvB-NwQxA   For more information on Resurface.io:
