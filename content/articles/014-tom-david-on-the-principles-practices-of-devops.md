Today I'm joined by Thomas McGonagle and Dr David Yates to discuss the principles and practices of DevOps. Thomas McGonagle is a Sales Engineer and DevOps evangelist at F5 Networks. Before joining F5, Thomas held positions at Cloudbees (maker of Jenkins) and Booz Allen Hamilton, in addition to running his own consulting business that heavily leveraged Puppet. Consistent throughout his career has been a strong focus on automation and orchestrations. Dr David Yates joins us from Bentley University where he is an Associate Professor of Computer Information Systems. Dr Yates has an MS & PhD in Computer Science, is co-inventor of 12 patents, and comes with hands-on experience in both Agile and DevOps. He is currently working on bringing these practices into the classroom. Listen to this episode to hear the principals and practices that Thomas and Dr Yates live by in terms of DevOps and automation. To summarize, we discuss these three principals:

*   Systems thinking (continuous delivery, continuous everything, …)
*   Continuous intelligence (from amplified feedback)
*   Continuous learning (from experimentation and practice)

And these 9 practices:

*   Practice 1: Configuration management
*   Practice 2: Continuous integration
*   Practice 3: Automated testing
*   Practice 4: Infrastructure as Code
*   Practice 5: Continuous delivery
*   Practice 6: Continuous deployment
*   Practice 7: Continuous monitoring
*   Practice 8: Develop an engaged and inclusive culture to encourage collaboration and shared ownership
*   Practice 9: Actively participate in communities of practice to become a lifelong learner of technology development (don’t be a jerk!)
