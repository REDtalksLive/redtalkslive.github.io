While the payoff of a successful implementation can be HUGE, the beginning of your Programmable Infrastructure journey may be difficult and fraught with danger. There are decisions you need to make right from the start that will dictate the experience you and your customers, external or internal, encounter. To avoid 'kicking an operational nightmare can further down the road' (or into the orchestrator as it may be), ensure you are employing declarative API interfaces and appropriate levels of abstraction in your automation tooling. In this episode I explain the importance of declarative API interfaces. Trying to move all of the knobs and buttons of programmable infrastructure into your deployment tooling WILL come back to bight you later. It will be costly to support, it will create an integration too rigid to adapt to new systems and services, and it will increasingly inhibit business agility as time goes on.
