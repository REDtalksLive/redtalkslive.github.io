In this episode I demonstrate how to automate the creation and distribution of AMIs across 4 AWS regions with the safety and reproducibility of version control.

I'm not a fan of using Snapshots because then I have to manage all the snapshots, and their distribution... But wait, there's "A New Hope"!

Star Wars references aside, watch this episode to see how pain free image management and distribution can be with GitHub, GitHub Actions, and HashiCorp [Packer](https://www.packer.io/).

There is no other way to manage them (unless you're into pain....).
