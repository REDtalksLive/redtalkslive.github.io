My good pal, Kin Lane, is back on the show for his third appearance to discuss the much debated topic of Imperative vs Declarative APIs. Key discussion points on this topic:

*   One is not necessarily better than the other.
*   One persons declarative is another persons imperative, so think about the 'system' of orchestration, and not just the device/software you're automating.
*   Think first about the 'API contract' ([episode #46](http://redtalks.live/2019/02/19/redtalks-live-46-api-contracts-w-kin-lane/), also with Kin Lane)
*   Scott Peter's and the API 'emoji poop'

Enough words from me, watch now! https://youtu.be/OAL67305sC4 Thanks for listening!
