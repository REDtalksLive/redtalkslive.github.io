Some great content from friends at World Wide Technology (WWT) explaining how the Super-NetOps Training Program differs from traditional infrastructure automation training.

"Its a very interesting and very exciting program" – Mark Wall

  In this podcast, live from the WWT Global Sales Conference in Las Vegas, Principle Solutions Architect, Joel King, and Practice Lead for Application Delivery, Mark Wall, explain what the Super-NetOps training program is all about and why its so important. **From the podcast** On the challenges organizations are facing, Mark Wall shares, "What it really boils down to is the infrastructure, the networking infrastructure, traditional IT Operations folks really have a very hard time keeping up with the development side of the organization." Wall continuous, "Theres a big gap in how the infrastructure side is able to deliver services that are required by the development organization. So, it almost boils down to '_I can't keep up_', '_I cant deliver those services fast enough_' or '_I don't really understand how my piece, my networking component, my application delivery component, fits into the public cloud or into this automated process'_ and there's kind of a disconnect in there." "That skillset gap is something that all of our customers ask about, and they struggle with. Traditional network engineers don't have the programming background. They don't have the understanding of some of the technologies around different data structures." adds Joel King, "How do I train those engineers to be able to have the skills that they need to do the type of automated deployments that Mark's talking about. That's a big key area for many of our customers is, what skills do I need, what training, what education do I need, and thats one of the things that the Super-NetOps program is trying to address. To enable those engineers with new skills to be able to be successful". WWT is supporting the Super-NetOps movement by putting together enterprise environments that support multiple technologies, beyond just F5's BIG-IP, to help customers build end-to-end solutions. **Conclusion** As I stated in my DevOps Enterprise Summit talk last year, "Give me a Swiss Army Knife, and MacGyver I do not become". So, its great to see Mark and Joel building upon the initial Super-NetOps program and adding huge value to their customers. Enough from me!
