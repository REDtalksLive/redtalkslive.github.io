Welcome to part 2 in this Network Infrastructure as Code series. In the previous episode we introduced the concept of Network Infrastructure as Code and performed a quick demonstration. In this episode we're going to cover best practices around Access Control and how to roll back changes.

Infrastructure as Code is a great stepping stone towards integrated and automated 'continuous deployment'. However, for those not quite ready to hand over control to an automated system, applying traditional approval processes to network infrastructure as code is probably a good idea. You'll also notice that Network Infrastructure as Code has great change back-out capabilities, much better than traditional management models.

Enough of the words, take a look at the video below and let me know your thoughts!
