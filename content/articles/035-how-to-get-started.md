In this episode I'm joined by F5 Consultant, Vinnie Mazza, to hear his experiences with getting started on his programmability and automation journey. Vinnie shares with us how a project outside of work  inspired him to learn new skills that, coincidentally, are directly transferable to the workplace. In this video you will see how, armed with no more than curiosity and a couple of Raspberry Pie's, Vinnie revolutionized a local police training facility that was in dire need of improvement. The skills he learned from this project not only helped others but also took him on a journey through scripting languages and frameworks that turned him into the automation-ninja that many customers get to appreciate today. Remember, listeners! Everyone starts from the beginning. Find a project, doesn't have to be at work, and see what you can come up with. https://youtu.be/F69Jzo51Mag Linked referenced in this episode:
