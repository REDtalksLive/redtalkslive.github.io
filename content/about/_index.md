## The purpose
[REDtalks.live](/) was created to share ideas and, hopefully, save people time when trying to understand some gnarly tech issues in the realm of automation/orchestration, cloud, and DevOps. 

## The brand
**RED**: Ranting, Engineers, DevOps

**talks**: its me, and occasionally a guest, talking (written and video form) through architecutre/process problems, challenges, and solutions.

**.live**: some humor, because its never live, but maybe I'll run some live hangouts some day. Happy to facilitate open discussions if its of interest.

## The people
The host, that's me [Nathan Pearce](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pearcenathan/). 
The guests, they are awesome people who have generously volunteered their time to discuss technology, architecture, and best practices for doing cool things right.
